%   ===================================================================
%   THIS IS NOT THE SIMULINK DELIVERABLE.
%
%   PS requirement 5 asks for a Simulink model specifically. That is
%   buildDistrictScreeningModel.m + districtScreeningSimEvents.slx, and it
%   is blocked until Simulink and SimEvents are installed (Task 0.0).
%
%   This file exists for two reasons:
%     1. to produce the district-scale numbers now rather than blocking on
%        an install;
%     2. to act as a VALIDATION ORACLE — once the SimEvents model is built,
%        it should reproduce these numbers on the same inputs. A material
%        disagreement means one of the two is wrong, which is worth finding
%        before the demo rather than during it.
%
%   Never present this as the Simulink deliverable. See README.md.

%   Model (design doc §7, §8.1):
%     stage 1  per-PHC upload queue, service time = image size / bandwidth
%     stage 2  tier triage — Tier A auto-clears and never reaches a reviewer
%     stage 3  reviewer pool, Tier C PREEMPTS Tier B (preemptive-resume)
%
%   Every parameter is a modelled assumption, not measured field data
%   (design doc §16). Say so when presenting results.

% grows to tens of thousands of cases, so the configurations worth studying were
% the ones too slow to run. Since there are only two reviewable tiers, one queue
% each gives O(1) dispatch -- take from C if non-empty, else B.
%
% Head/tail indices rather than queue(1) = [], because deleting the front of a
% MATLAB array reallocates the whole thing on every dispatch.
