/**
 * qualityGateClient.js
 *
 * Node ↔ MATLAB bridge for the quality gate.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE — "MATLAB Engine API for JavaScript" does not exist.
 * MathWorks provides official engine APIs for Python, Java, C/C++, and .NET
 * only.  The Task 1.6 spec mentions it, but there is no such npm package.
 *
 * Bridge strategy: child_process calling `matlab -batch`.
 *   • MATLAB runs qualityGateMain.m, jsonencode()s the result struct, and
 *     prints it to stdout.  Node reads stdout and JSON.parse()s it.
 *   • MATLAB startup takes 3–8 s.  To avoid paying that cost per request,
 *     this module keeps a shared "warm" promise that pre-launches MATLAB
 *     during server startup (see warmUp() below), so the first real request
 *     doesn't incur the cold-start penalty.
 * TASK 8.1 — TWO BACKENDS, SELECTED AT RUNTIME.
 *   Set QUALITY_GATE_EXE to a compiled qualityGate executable and this module
 *   shells out to that instead of launching MATLAB. The PHC machine then needs
 *   only the free MATLAB Runtime rather than a licensed MATLAB install, which
 *   is the main win. It is also faster, but modestly: MEASURED warm on the dev
 *   machine, ~9.1 s per call via matlab -batch against ~4.6 s via the exe.
 *   About 2x. An earlier version of this comment claimed ~50 ms, which was
 *   never measured and was wrong — the Runtime still initialises on every
 *   invocation, because every call is a fresh process.
 *
 *   Both paths are kept, deliberately. Developers here have MATLAB and no
 *   compiled build; PHCs will have the exe and no MATLAB. Making the compiled
 *   path mandatory would mean nobody could run the gate until someone
 *   remembered to compile it, and deleting the MATLAB path would make every
 *   change to a .m file require a rebuild before it could be tested.
 *
 *   The two produce byte-identical JSON — qualityGateCli.m calls the same
 *   qualityGateMain and jsonencode()s the same struct — so everything below
 *   the spawn is shared. That sharing is the point: a second parser for the
 *   compiled path is a second thing to drift.
 *
 * MATLAB must be on the system PATH, OR set MATLAB_EXECUTABLE env var to the
 * full path, e.g.:
 *   $env:MATLAB_EXECUTABLE = "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2024b\bin\matlab.exe"
