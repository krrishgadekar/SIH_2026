/**
 * captureHandler.js  (Task 3.1)
 *
 * Takes a freshly captured fundus image, stores it, runs the local quality
 * gate over it, and records the outcome.
 *
 *   handleCapture(patientId, imageFile, cameraDeviceId)
 *     -> { captureId, patientId, qualityStatus, qualityReason, retakeCount, capturedAt }
 *
 * The returned object is EXACTLY the POST /captures response body from
 * api-contracts.md -- camelCase, ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, string IDs. The route
 * in Task 3.2 should be able to `res.status(201).json(await handleCapture(...))`
 * with no reshaping in between.
 *
 * ORDER OF OPERATIONS, and why
 *   1. write the image to disk
 *   2. INSERT the capture row with quality_status = 'pending'
 *   3. run the quality gate (slow -- spawns MATLAB)
 *   4. UPDATE the row with the real status/reason, and -- atomically with it --
 *      enqueue the capture for sync if it passed
 *
 * The row is inserted BEFORE the gate runs so that a MATLAB crash, a timeout,
 * or the technician closing the laptop mid-check cannot lose the capture. The
 * image is already on disk and the row already points at it, so the case can be
 * re-gated later instead of asking the patient to sit back down.
 *
 * 'pending' is therefore a real, persisted state -- but it is an INTERNAL one.
 * api-contracts.md's qualityStatus enum is only pass/retake/borderline, so a
 * 'pending' row is never returned over HTTP: if the gate fails, this function
 * throws and the row stays 'pending' for later repair.
