%   ── WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
%   qualityGateMain used to find its presets with
%
%       fullfile(fileparts(mfilename('fullpath')), 'cameraPresets.json')
%
%   which is correct under MATLAB and WRONG inside a compiled executable. In a
%   deployed application mfilename('fullpath') resolves into the CTF archive,
%   not to a directory on disk, so fileread() fails — and it fails at the first
%   real capture on a PHC machine, not at build time, with an error that reads
%   like a missing file rather than a packaging mistake.
%
%   This is the single most common way a working MATLAB program breaks when it
%   is compiled, and it is invisible until the exe runs on a machine that has
%   no MATLAB and no source tree to accidentally fall back to.
%
%   Under `mcc -a`, added files land under ctfroot, sometimes at the root and
%   sometimes under a path mirroring their source folder depending on how they
%   were added. Rather than depend on which, this checks the plausible
%   locations and reports all of them if none matched — a build error a human
%   can act on, instead of "file not found".
