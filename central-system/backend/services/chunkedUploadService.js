/**
 * chunkedUploadService.js  (Task 8.2)
 *
 * Resumable, integrity-checked image upload for PHCs on poor links.
 *
 *   initSession(captureRef, meta)      open (or re-open) an upload session
 *   getSession(captureRef)             which chunks the server already holds
 *   putChunk(captureRef, index, buf, sha256)
 *   completeSession(captureRef)        assemble, verify, ingest, enqueue
 *   sweepStale(maxAgeMs)               reap abandoned sessions
 *
 * ── The problem ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single-shot POST of a 15 MB fundus image over a rural link either finishes
 * or it does not. If the connection drops at 90%, the next attempt starts again
 * at zero — and on a link bad enough to drop once, it will drop again, so a
 * large image can fail indefinitely while smaller ones sail past it. The sync
 * queue never drains, and the case that will not upload is often the referable
 * one somebody is waiting on.
 *
 * Chunking makes progress durable: whatever arrived stays arrived, and a resume
 * asks the server what it already has and sends only the gaps.
 *
 * ── Why the session is keyed on captureIdRef, not a server-issued id ────────
 * The PHC already has a globally unique id for the capture (`ids.js`:
 * PHC001-lz3k9f-a2x9), minted offline without coordination. Using it as the
 * session key means a client that crashes and restarts can resume without
 * having kept any server-issued token — it re-derives the key from its own
 * database row. A server-issued uploadId would have to be persisted locally to
 * survive exactly the crash this feature exists to tolerate.
 *
 * It also makes the whole flow idempotent: re-completing a finished session
 * returns the original caseId instead of ingesting the same scan twice.
 *
 * ── Integrity is not optional here ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reassembling a fundus image from pieces that crossed a flaky link creates a
 * failure mode single-shot upload does not have: a file that is complete in
 * length, decodes as a valid JPEG, and is subtly wrong. That image would be
 * graded, and the grade would be reported to a clinician with no indication
 * anything was amiss.
 *
 * So every chunk carries a SHA-256 that is verified on receipt (catching
 * corruption at the 1 MB chunk, not after a 15 MB assembly), and the assembled
 * file is verified against a whole-file SHA-256 committed at init. A mismatch
 * refuses to ingest. Nothing is graded that cannot be shown to be exactly what
 * the PHC captured.
