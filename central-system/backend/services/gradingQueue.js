/**
 * gradingQueue.js  (Task 8.3)
 *
 * A real job queue in front of the grading pipeline, replacing the synchronous
 * `await processCase(caseId)` that Task 3.3 put directly in the POST handler.
 *
 *   enqueue(caseId)      hand a case to the workers; returns immediately
 *   start()              begin draining (idempotent)
 *   stop({drain})        stop taking new work; optionally wait for inflight
 *   onIdle()             promise that resolves when nothing is queued or inflight
 *   recoverStranded()    re-enqueue cases the database says are unfinished
 *   stats()              { queued, inflight, processed, failed, concurrency }
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A MATLAB grading run takes tens of seconds. Doing it inside the request meant
 * the PHC's upload connection was held open for the whole run, over exactly the
 * bad rural link this system is designed around: the sync manager's 600 s
 * upload timeout was being spent mostly on grading, not transfer. Two PHCs
 * syncing at once queued behind each other inside Express with no visibility,
 * and a client that gave up got no result even though the work had been done.
 *
 * Now the POST returns as soon as the case is durably stored, and grading
 * happens behind it. The client polls GET /cases/:id/status, which is what that
 * endpoint was always for.
 *
 * ── Why there is no 'queued' status ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * api-contracts.md pins the status enum to processing | graded | error, and the
 * database CHECK constraint enforces it. "Queued" is not a distinct fact for
 * any client: from outside, waiting-for-a-worker and being-graded are the same
 * state — the answer is not ready, keep polling. Adding a fourth value would
 * change a published contract to express a distinction only this module cares
 * about. Queue position is available through stats() instead.
 *
 * ── The failure this module exists to prevent ───────────────────────────────
 * The queue is in memory. A restart therefore loses every pending job, while
 * the database still says those cases are 'processing'. Nothing would ever pick
 * them up again: no error, no retry, no log line — a patient's scan sitting
 * forever in a state that means "any moment now". That is a worse failure than
 * the blocking request this task replaces, and it is invisible.
 *
 * recoverStranded() is the answer, and server.js calls it at boot. The database
 * is the queue of record; this module is only the work order.

// each pointless retry re-runs Branch A and four segmentation models — about
// 35 s of inference to rediscover that an executable is still absent.
