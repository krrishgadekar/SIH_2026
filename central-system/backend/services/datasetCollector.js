/**
 * datasetCollector.js — turn each review into a labelled training example.
 *
 * When an ophthalmologist decides a case, a human has just labelled a real
 * fundus photograph. recordLabel() captures that, inside the same transaction
 * as the review itself: a label written afterwards, best-effort, is a label
 * that silently goes missing whenever the second write fails, and nothing
 * downstream would ever notice a gap in a training corpus.
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS A LABEL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both decisions do.
 *
 *   override  the reviewer says the grade is X. Label = X. This is the signal
 *             `corrections` was already recording.
 *   confirm   the reviewer says the model's grade is right. Label = the model
 *             grade. Just as much a human judgement, and normally the majority
 *             of reviews — a corpus of overrides alone is a corpus of the
 *             model's mistakes, which trains a model that has only ever seen
 *             its own failures.
 *
 * A confirm whose model grade is unknown is NOT recorded. There is no label to
 * record: "the reviewer agreed with something we cannot name" is not data.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not copy the image anywhere. The bytes already live under
 * media/cases/<caseId>/, and a second copy per review is duplicated patient
 * imagery that must then be secured, backed up and deleted in two places.
 * scripts/exportTrainingSet.js materialises a corpus when someone actually
 * wants one, and stamps the rows it used.
 *
 * It does not decide whether a label may be used for training. It records the
 * consent that existed at labelling time and lets the exporter enforce it —
 * one place to reason about, and the record stays truthful even for rows the
 * export refuses.
