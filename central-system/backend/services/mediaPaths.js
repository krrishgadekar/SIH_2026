/**
 * mediaPaths.js
 *
 * The one definition of where a case's files live on disk and what URL they are
 * served at.
 *
 * api-contracts.md's case-detail response returns
 *
 *     "imageUrl":          "/media/cases/a1b2c3d4/original.jpg"
 *     "gradCamOverlayUrl": "/media/cases/a1b2c3d4/gradcam.png"
 *
 * and server.js serves `/media` statically from `backend/media`. So the URL and
 * the filesystem path are two views of the same fact, and they have to be
 * derived together — a file written anywhere else is simply not reachable by
 * the frontend, silently, with a 404 on an image the API said existed.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: gradingOrchestrator.js originally wrote Grad-CAM
 * PNGs to `backend/explainability-outputs/`, which is outside the static root.
 * The path stored in the database was correct and the file was really there,
 * and the contract's URL could still never have resolved.
 *
 * Both this module's consumers — ingestionService.js (original image) and
 * gradingOrchestrator.js (Grad-CAM overlay) — must use these helpers rather
 * than building paths of their own.
