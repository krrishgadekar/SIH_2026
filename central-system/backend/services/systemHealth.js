/**
 * systemHealth.js -- the four checks behind GET /api/v1/admin/system-health
 * (backend plan §F, design doc §10.7 / §1.17).
 *
 * A PHC gone silent, a grading job stuck, a dead MATLAB session and a referable
 * case nobody has reviewed are the same class of failure: nothing errors, the
 * system just quietly stops doing its job for someone. Each gets a threshold
 * and they are reported together, in one response, for one admin screen.
 *
 * Thresholds (env, all optional):
 *   SILENT_PHC_HOURS       48   no contact of any kind for this long
 *   STUCK_JOB_MINUTES      15   'processing' this long with no recent recovery
 *                               (normal grading is ~12.5 s)
 *   UNREVIEWED_CASE_HOURS  48   referable, never reviewed, received this long ago
