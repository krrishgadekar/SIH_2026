 *
 * Two workers use it: the MATLAB inference session
 * (ml-pipeline/inference/matlabSession) and the Python segmentation worker
 * (ml-pipeline/inference/segSession). They run different languages and
 * different models, and the transport between them and Node is identical:
 * write a request file, poll for the matching response, both sides
 * temp-then-rename so neither observes a partial file.
 *
 * It lives in one place because it did not, once. Three callers had grown
 * their own copy and they differed in small ways that were bugs waiting to
 * happen -- one reclaimed a timed-out request file and one did not, so a slow
 * worker could still pick up work nobody was waiting for and leave an orphan
 * response next to it.
 *
 * WHY A DIRECTORY AND NOT A SOCKET: no extra dependency on either side, and
 * every step is inspectable with a directory listing -- a stuck request is a
 * file you can read, not opaque socket state. Throughput is not the goal; one
 * case at a time is the load shape, and a 50 ms poll is far under the
 * multi-second budget this exists to protect.
