auditTieringBehavioral.py — behavioral audit of the live confidence-routing
decision, for 5 synthetic cases (see docs audit request).

UPDATED after the camera/site-probation and quality-forced overrides were
wired into gradingOrchestrator.js's processCase(). Re-run after that change,
not just spot-checked, per the follow-up request that added those overrides.

There is still no single exported "decideTier(...)" function in this codebase
(see the original audit, item 1) -- the real decision is split across:
  - branchAInfer.py:200-228  assign_tier(probs, calib)      [REAL, imported]
  - gradingOrchestrator.js:357-362  assignTier(confidence, branchAgreement)
                                     [REAL, invoked via node subprocess below]
  - gradingOrchestrator.js:isCaptureUngradable  [REAL, invoked via node
                                     subprocess below -- pure and synchronous,
                                     so no reason to re-implement it either]
  - gradingOrchestrator.js:hasClearedCameraSiteProbation  [REAL function, but
                                     queries the live Postgres case history --
                                     this audit supplies its boolean RESULT
                                     directly per scenario rather than standing
                                     up a database, same as it already treats
                                     conformal_tier/branchAgreement as given
                                     inputs rather than re-deriving them from a
                                     live pipeline]
  - gradingOrchestrator.js:669-692  the inline if/else chain in processCase()
                                     that actually decides the stored tier
                                     [reproduced verbatim below, cited by line,
                                     because it is not factored into a callable
                                     function -- that fact IS the finding]

conformal tiers below come from the real assign_tier() against the real
calibration_v1.json. assignTier() and isCaptureUngradable() are invoked for
real via `node -e` to avoid re-implementing either. The 669-692 chain, and the
one-line `cameraProbationOverride = mismatch && !cleared` combinator ahead of
it, are reproduced verbatim (comment-for-comment) since neither is
independently callable.
