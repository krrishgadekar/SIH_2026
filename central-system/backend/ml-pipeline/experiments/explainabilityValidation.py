===========================
Task 9.4 -- quantitative explainability validation.

    python explainabilityValidation.py [--n N]

Task 9.4 has three parts. This does the two that are measurable from code, and
reports the third as NOT DONE rather than quietly dropping it.

  1. Lesion-attention consistency (Task 7.1)      -- measured here
  2. Counterfactual occlusion test (Task 7.1)     -- measured here
  3. The "<30 s ophthalmologist validation" claim -- NOT MEASURED. It needs a
     real timer on the review screen writing
     ophthalmologist_reviews.review_duration_seconds, which does not exist yet.
     The DoD is a median with n stated; today n = 0. An unqualified "under 30
     seconds" would be a fabricated number, and the PS asks for a measured one.
  4. Clinician plausibility rating                -- NOT DONE, and cannot be.
     "Grad-CAM rated as clinically useful" is a human judgement. Self-assessing
     it would be worthless.

── WHY THIS IS ONLY NOW POSSIBLE ───────────────────────────────────────────
Both measures compare Grad-CAM against a LESION MASK. Until the segmentation
models were delivered and verified there was no mask, so 7.1 was built,
unit-tested on synthetic arrays, and left returning null on real cases. The
masks now reproduce their own published Dice, so the measures can run on real
data for the first time.

Note this is unaffected by the rule-engine count-scale problem: that concerns
how many DISCRETE lesions the counts should report, while these measures use
the mask as a region. A mask that is right about WHERE lesions are is enough
here even while the counting convention is unresolved.

── THE TWO MEASURES, AND WHY BOTH ──────────────────────────────────────────
ATTENTION CONSISTENCY asks whether the heatmap sits on lesions. Reported
against its CHANCE level -- the fraction of the retina the lesions occupy --
because a raw "62% of attention is on lesions" is meaningless if lesions cover
60% of the image. Enrichment (observed / chance) is the honest number, and 1.0
means the heatmap is no better than pointing anywhere.

OCCLUSION asks something consistency cannot: whether the model is USING that
evidence. A heatmap can sit on lesions that the model ignores -- attention
correlates with saliency, not with causation. So the lesions are removed by
inpainting and the model re-run: if the confidence in the original grade does
not fall, the highlighted region was not what drove the decision, and the
explanation is decorative.

Inpainting rather than blacking out, because a black patch is itself a strong
out-of-distribution stimulus. Confidence would drop for the wrong reason and
the test would pass while proving nothing.
