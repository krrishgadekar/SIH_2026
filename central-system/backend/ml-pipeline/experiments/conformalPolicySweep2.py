conformalPolicySweep2.py
=========================
Re-run of conformalPolicySweep.py's conformal policy sweep with a CORRECTED
nonconformity score, plus one new mitigation config (C6). CPU-only, reads
only saved arrays (models/Model1/v2a/*.npy), never retrains, never touches
production code or config. A NEW file: conformalPolicySweep.py and its
outputs (diagnostics/out/conformal_policy_sweep.{json,txt}) are untouched.
This script writes to different filenames
(diagnostics/out/conformal_policy_sweep2.{json,txt}) so nothing is
overwritten. This script does not commit anything to git.

── WHY A SECOND SCRIPT: THE SCORE IN C1-C5 WAS DEFECTIVE ──────────────────────
conformalPolicySweep.py's score (== production's ordinal_mode_interval_score,
inference/branchAInfer.py) is s(k) = the probability mass of the interval
[mode,k] INCLUDING k's own probability. At k = mode itself, that is just
s(mode) = p(mode) -- for a correct, CONFIDENT prediction (the case conformal
calibration should find LEAST surprising), p(mode) is close to 1, so s(mode)
is close to the MAXIMUM possible score. A calibration example with a correct,
confident top pick therefore looks like one of the WORST (highest-non-
conformity) points in the whole calibration set, not one of the best. Fed
through the standard "qhat = the (1-alpha) quantile of the score" step, the
quantile ends up being set by ordinary confident-correct cases rather than by
genuine errors -- qhat saturates toward 1 for every class (see
conformalPolicySweep.py's own C1 cross-fit output:
mean_qhatPerClass=[0.998, 0.986, 0.972, 0.975, 0.997], all near the
theoretical maximum of 1.0). Because conformalTiering.m/assign_tier() also
force the mode into the prediction set unconditionally (a real, separate,
CORRECT design choice -- "the model must be allowed to believe itself"), a
qhat near 1 makes almost every OTHER grade satisfy s(k)<=qhat too, and sets
balloon: mean set size ~3.09 for C1, and every config in the first sweep
converges to a similar number (see conformal_policy_sweep.txt). Marginal
coverage for C1 came out at 97.7% against an intended-90% target (C4 alpha=
0.10 was 98.8% -- even more extreme, since C4 has only ONE group's worth of
confident-correct cases feeding one shared quantile). This is
OVER-coverage caused by the score rewarding confidence in the wrong
direction, not a sign the method is conservative-by-design.

── CORRECTED SCORE v3 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    s(mode) = 0                              (ties in the mode -> higher grade)
    s(k) for k != mode:
        s(k) = [sum of p_j over the closed interval between mode and k]
               - p_k

Equivalently, s(k) is the probability mass STRICTLY BETWEEN the mode and k
(the mass you must "skip over" to reach k), never counting k's own
probability or the mode's own probability as the "cost" of extending the set
out to k. This is still non-decreasing moving away from the mode in either
direction (each additional step away adds a new interior term to the sum),
so {k : s(k) <= q} is still a contiguous interval containing the mode for
any q -- the conformal-validity argument ("coverage holds for ANY fixed,
data-independent score function measured consistently at calibration and
inference time") never depended on which score was used, only on using the
SAME one both times. s(mode)=0 by construction (mode==k means the interval
is a single point whose own mass is entirely subtracted off), so a correct,
confident case now correctly reads as the LEAST surprising point, not the
most.

── PRODUCTION CODE REUSED, UNCHANGED -- AND WHY THIS SCRIPT REIMPLEMENTS THE
   REST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nothing in inference/branchAInfer.py or inference/branchAInferMatlab.m is
imported here, and neither file is modified. Both are hardwired to the OLD
score (branchAInfer.assign_tier() calls ordinal_mode_interval_score(), which
IS the defective score above) -- there is no way to hand assign_tier() a
different score function without editing production code, which this task
forbids. So this script carries its own generic, score-agnostic tiering
function (assign_tier_ordinal below) that reproduces assign_tier()'s exact
algorithm (mode always a member, contiguous hull, EPS boundary guard, Tier
A/B/C from [low,high] vs REFERABLE_FROM) parameterised by which score
function computes the per-candidate scores. This is also why
conformalPolicySweep.py's helper functions (fit_temperature,
true_scores/predicted_mode, fit_group_qhat, evaluate_ordinal_config,
fold_metrics, ...) are NOT imported from that file either, even though they
are not "production code": Step 1 below needs an INDEPENDENTLY-written copy
of the whole harness, run with the OLD score, checked against the FROZEN
numbers in conformal_policy_sweep.json -- importing the same function
objects and calling them again would only prove this script can call
conformalPolicySweep.py, not that a fresh implementation of the same
arithmetic agrees with the persisted result of a previous run.

── STEP 1: REPRODUCE THE FIRST SWEEP'S C1 WITH THE OLD SCORE, THEN SWITCH ────
Before trusting anything new, this script rebuilds the exact same cross-fit
protocol (10 repeats x 5-fold StratifiedKFold, random_state=repeat, same
pooling order: val then test) with C1's OLD (defective) score and diffs the
resulting mean_set_size / coverage_marginal / tierA,B,C shares /
false_auto_clear_ref_rate / mean_qhatPerClass against
diagnostics/out/conformal_policy_sweep.json's saved C1 cross-fit numbers.
Only once that reproduction matches (small floating-point tolerance) does
the script proceed to compute anything with v3.

── C0 IN THIS SCRIPT: "+ HULL" ─────────────────────────────────────────────
conformalPolicySweep.py's C0 reported RAW (possibly gapped, possibly empty)
LAC set sizes for its size-share stats, and used the [low,high] envelope only
for coverage/safety. This script's C0 additionally HULLS the raw set (when
non-empty) for the size-share stats too, so C0's "mean set size" /
size-share numbers are computed the same way as every ordinal config's
(always-contiguous) numbers -- an apples-to-apples comparison, as the task
asks for ("C0 ... + hull"). The empty-set case is unaffected (a hull of
nothing is still nothing; frac_empty_set is still reported separately).

── C6: A REFERABLE-SAFETY GATE ON TOP OF C4v3 ──────────────────────────────
Base sets/tiers = C4v3 (marginal Mondrian, alpha=0.10, v3 score). On the
calibration half of each fold: tau = the ceil((n+1)*alpha_ref)-th SMALLEST
value of P(g>=2) = p2+p3+p4, among calibration points whose TRUE grade is
referable (>=2). Since alpha_ref is small (0.02/0.03/0.05), this is a LOW
quantile of the referable population's own P(g>=2) -- i.e. tau is small
enough that only ~alpha_ref of genuinely-referable calibration cases have
P(g>=2) at or below it. At evaluation: a case is only touched by the gate if
C4v3 already places it in Tier A (its set lies entirely within {0,1}). Such
a case is DEMOTED to Tier B unless its OWN P(g>=2) <= tau -- i.e. it survives
as Tier A only if it looks at least as clearly non-referable, in raw
probability terms, as the least-referable-looking alpha_ref fraction of
genuine referable cases. This is a strict, one-sided safety net: it can only
ever move cases OUT of Tier A, never into it, and never touches Tier B/C.

  SATURATION (rank > n, i.e. too few referable calibration points at this
  alpha_ref -- expected to be rare given pooled referable n~503, but guarded
  for completeness): the SAFE direction for this gate is the opposite of
  conformalCalibrate.m's qhat saturation. There, saturating to qhat=1 means
  "always INCLUDE" (safe = wider sets, since excluding a grade wrongly is the
  dangerous mistake). Here, the dangerous mistake is a Tier-A survival that
  should not have happened, so the safe direction is a STRICT gate: on
  saturation this script sets tau=0.0 (demotes essentially every Tier-A case
  in that fold), rather than tau=max(observed), which would be permissive.
  This choice is not specified by the task and is flagged as SATURATED in
  the per-config report whenever it fires.
