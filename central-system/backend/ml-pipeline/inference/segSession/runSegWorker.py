"""Persistent segmentation worker (backend plan §S.4's open item).

Loads M2-M5 once, then polls a request directory for images to segment. Each
request is one image; each response is the JSON segInfer.py has always printed
to stdout, written back under the matching request id.

    python runSegWorker.py

Do not run this directly for real use -- manageSegWorker.ps1 in this folder is
the documented start/stop/status interface (background process, log
redirection, PID tracking). This script never daemonizes; it blocks until told
to stop and expects whatever launched it to have put it in the background.

STOP: create a file named 'stop.flag' in this directory.

-- WHY --------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation was the largest remaining cost in grading a case, and almost none
of it was segmentation. Measured on this machine:

    torch import + 4 model loads   17.1 s   <- paid on EVERY case
    actual work per image           2.0 s

Spawning `segInfer.py` per case paid that 17 s every time. This pays it once,
at start-up.

It is also why backend plan §S.4 found that serving M2-M4 from the MATLAB
session gave no speed-up at all (22.5 s vs 21.4 s over 20 images): the forward
passes it moved were under a second each, while the process start it did NOT
move was seventeen. Moving the forward passes was never going to show up.

-- THE PROTOCOL -----------------------------------------------------------
Deliberately the same file protocol as the MATLAB session next door
(inference/matlabSession/), for the same reasons: no extra dependency, and
every step is inspectable with a directory listing -- a stuck request is a file
sitting in requests/, not opaque socket state. The Node side speaks to both
through one client (services/sessionClient.js).

    requests/<id>.json    {"image": "...", "outdir": "...", "minArea": 10}
    responses/<id>.json   segInfer's result dict, or {"error": "..."}

Both sides write temp-then-rename, so neither ever observes a partial file.

-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE ----------------------------------------------
Nothing about the numbers. It calls segInfer.run_one, which is the same code
path the command line uses -- every preprocessing step, threshold, optic-disc
mask, component filter and quadrant assignment is untouched, so the counts the
ICDR thresholds were calibrated against cannot drift because of this file.
