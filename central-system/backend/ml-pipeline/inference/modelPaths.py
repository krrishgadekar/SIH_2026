modelPaths.py
=============
Find a model checkpoint by FILENAME, anywhere under ml-pipeline/models/.

    from modelPaths import resolve_checkpoint
    path = resolve_checkpoint("branchA_v1.pt")

── WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A CONSTANT ─────────────────────────────────────────
The weights are not in git. They are 16-280 MB each, two of them over GitHub's
100 MB per-file limit, so they are distributed out of band and live only on
whichever machine someone copied them onto. That has two consequences this
module exists to handle.

FIRST: the folder layout is not stable. The five checkpoints currently sit in
Model1/, vessel_predictions(Model2)/, Model3/, Model4/ and
red_lesion_predictions(model5)/ — three different naming conventions, and
Tanuj's handover notes that an IDE keeps reorganising them. A hardcoded
"models/Model1/branchA_v1.pt" breaks the moment anyone tidies the directory,
and it breaks on a machine where the files were unzipped into a different
shape. The filename is the stable identifier; the path is not.

SECOND: an absent checkpoint must fail LOUDLY and say what is missing. This
already happened once. A teammate's commit deleted branchA_v1.pt from the repo;
merging it removed the file from the working tree, and the next grading call
would have failed inside model loading. Without a clear message that reads as
"a build artefact you have to obtain separately is missing", it looks like a
code bug and gets debugged as one.

So the error below names the file, the directory searched, and how to fix it,
rather than letting a FileNotFoundError surface from three frames deep.

── AMBIGUITY IS AN ERROR, NOT A COIN FLIP ──────────────────────────────────
If two files with the same name exist under models/, this raises rather than
picking the first. Duplicate checkpoints are usually a half-finished
reorganisation or an older copy left behind, and silently loading whichever one
os.walk reached first would mean the pipeline's behaviour depends on directory
iteration order. That is precisely the kind of difference that shows up as an
unreproducible grade and is nearly impossible to trace afterwards.
