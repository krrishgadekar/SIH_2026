==========
Grad-CAM for Branch A, against the model that actually made the decision.

    from gradcam import compute_gradcam, save_overlay

── WHY THIS EXISTS IN PYTHON ───────────────────────────────────────────────
There is a MATLAB gradCam.m, and it can only load the untrained stub. Once
Branch A moved to Python, a heatmap produced there would have been explaining
a DIFFERENT network than the one that produced the grade — an explanation
confidently unrelated to its prediction, which is worse than no explanation.
So gradcam_path was set to null, and this closes that gap properly.

── THE TARGET LAYER, AND ITS HONEST RESOLUTION ─────────────────────────────
Hooked at `backbone.bn2.act` — the activation after the final convolution,
the last point where spatial position still exists. After it comes global
pooling, which discards location entirely, so nothing later can be localised.

For a 384x384 input that feature map is 12x12. EACH CELL THEREFORE COVERS
32x32 PIXELS. Upsampling to 384 makes a smooth picture but invents no detail:
the heatmap genuinely cannot resolve anything smaller than a 32-pixel block.

That matters clinically. A microaneurysm is a handful of pixels across, so
Grad-CAM can indicate the REGION the model weighted and can never point at an
individual lesion. Design doc §6.9 says the same thing, and it is the reason
the lesion-attention consistency score (Task 7.1) exists as a separate check
rather than the heatmap being trusted on its own.

── THE ROI SAFEGUARD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Design doc §6.9 requires heatmap energy outside the retinal circle to be
discounted. A CNN will happily key on the black surround or the vignette edge
— artefacts of the camera, not the eye — and such a heatmap looks confident
and means nothing. Attention outside the retina is zeroed here, and how much
was removed is reported, because a case where most of the attention was
outside the eye is itself a finding.
