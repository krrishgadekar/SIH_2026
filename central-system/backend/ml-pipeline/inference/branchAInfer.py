branchAInfer.py
===============
Branch A inference. Reads a fundus image, returns a graded result as JSON.

    python branchAInfer.py <imagePath>

Prints ONE line of JSON to stdout and nothing else on success:

    {"drGradeCnn": 2, "confidenceScore": 0.71, "conformalTier": "B", ...}

Exit codes:
    0  success, JSON on stdout
    2  wrong arguments
    3  inference failed (unreadable image, missing model, ...)

── WHY THIS IS PYTHON AND NOT MATLAB ───────────────────────────────────────
The design doc requires MATLAB for the image-analysis and modelling code,
including both grading branches, and that was tested rather than waived.
MATLAB's official converter imports this network and computes the WRONG
NUMBERS: on identical input tensors it agrees with the model's published
logits on 8-11% of cases with a correlation of -0.25, while Python reproduces
them to 0.0050 with 100% agreement. The structure imports correctly, which is
what makes it dangerous -- only running it against known-good outputs catches
it. See testImportedNetwork.m; re-run it when the converter is updated.

So Branch A runs here. Everything that does not need the model's internals
stays in MATLAB: quality gate, camera calibration, the ICDR rule engine,
conformal tiering, the evidence report, Simulink.

── ERRORS GO TO STDERR, NEVER STDOUT ───────────────────────────────────────
Node parses stdout as JSON. A traceback printed there would be read as a
malformed result rather than a failure, and the orchestrator would report a
parse error instead of the real cause. stdout carries exactly one thing.

── THE PREPROCESSING IS NOT A CHOICE ───────────────────────────────────────
ben_graham_preprocess is imported from the training code, not reimplemented.
A model only ever sees what preprocessing hands it, and this project has
already measured what a mismatched chain costs: adding a CLAHE stage that
training never used dropped agreement with the model's own outputs from 100%
to 57.7%. If the training preprocessing changes, this import follows it
automatically -- which is the entire reason it is an import.

    """Temperature and conformal thresholds, fitted by calibrateBranchA.m.

    Absent calibration is NOT silently treated as "no calibration needed".
    T defaults to 1.0 only with an explicit flag in the output, because an
    uncalibrated confidence flowing into the Tier A/B/C routing would look
    exactly like a calibrated one and would route cases on numbers that mean
    something different.

    METHOD GUARD (2026-09-20, updated for score v3): the file at CALIB_PATH
    must declare method == EXPECTED_CALIB_METHOD (the referable-stratified
    ordinal mode-interval scheme, score v3, assign_tier() below implements).
    Unlike the trainedImgSize check, a MISSING or mismatched method is always
    a hard refusal, never treated as "legacy and unverifiable" -- neither the
    old marginal-LAC schema (a single qhat/probThreshold) nor the v2
    per-CLASS Mondrian schema (qhatPerClass, no qhatPerStratum/
    referableThreshold) has fields this code could silently fall back to
    reading, and that is the point: there must be no path from a stale file
    (of either older schema) to a score/tiering rule this code no longer
    implements. See calibration_v1_marginal_lac_ARCHIVE.json for the LAC
    schema; the v2 per-class schema this replaces is 'ordinal_mode_interval_
    mondrian_v2' (qhatPerClass), now equally refused.

    VERSION GUARD (2026-09-19): pass the loaded checkpoint (load_checkpoint())
    and this refuses to treat calibration_v1.json's qhatPerStratum/temperature
    as valid if the file's trainedImgSize doesn't match ckpt["img_size"] --
    e.g. a v2 model trained at 512/640 with a v1-fitted file still in place.
    qhatPerStratum is a quantile of ONE model's nonconformity scores and means
    nothing for a differently-trained one. A calibration file with no
    trainedImgSize field at all (but the right method) is NOT treated as a
    mismatch (nothing to compare), only as unverifiable -- it degrades the
    same way a missing file does, calibrated=True but flagged, not a hard
    failure.

    MODEL-VERSION GUARD (v2a integration, GATE 4): the file must also declare
    modelVersion == BRANCH_A_MODEL_VERSION. CALIB_PATH already points at a
    version-specific filename (never calibration_v1.json for a non-v1
    version), so this guard is a second, explicit check rather than the only
    thing standing between two models' thresholds -- belt and braces, not
    redundant: a copy-pasted file with the right name but a stale
    modelVersion field inside it must still be refused, not silently
    accepted because the filename happened to match.
