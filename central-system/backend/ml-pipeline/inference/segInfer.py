segInfer.py
===========
Phase 4 segmentation and localization: models M2-M5, one process, one JSON.

    python segInfer.py <imagePath> --outdir DIR

Prints ONE line of JSON to stdout. Errors go to stderr, never stdout, for the
same reason as branchAInfer.py: Node parses stdout as JSON, so a traceback
printed there is read as a malformed result instead of a failure.

Exit codes:  0 success   2 bad arguments   3 inference failed

── WHY ALL FOUR RUN IN ONE PROCESS ─────────────────────────────────────────
Interpreter start plus four model loads dominates the cost; four spawns would
pay it four times. They are also not independent -- M4's optic-disc masking
needs M3's disc centre -- so splitting them would mean passing coordinates
between processes for no gain.

── THE THREE COORDINATE SPACES, WHICH ARE THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY ─────────────
This is the part that silently produces plausible, wrong output.

  ORIGINAL      the photograph as captured, HxW.
  SQUISH-512    original resized to 512x512 ignoring aspect. M3 only.
  CROP-512      ben_graham's retinal crop box, resized to 512x512. M4, M5.
  PAD-512       aspect-preserving resize + centre zero-pad. M2 only.

Every model works in a different one, and NONE of them is the original. A mask
produced in CROP-512 and read as if it were SQUISH-512 still looks like a
lesion mask -- it is just in the wrong place, and since quadrant counts are what
the ICDR rule engine grades on, the grade changes without anything failing.

M4 is the sharp edge: its optic-disc masking is trained-in behaviour that the
model does NOT apply, so the caller must. The disc comes from M3 in SQUISH-512;
the mask must be applied in CROP-512. Mapping between them is via
retinal_crop_box(), which is why that was factored out of ben_graham rather
than reimplemented.

── WHAT IS PROVEN AND WHAT IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────
M3's recipe is PROVEN: it reproduces the model's own published predictions on
77/78 images (verifyModel3.py). That verification also established that
interpolation is not a detail -- INTER_AREA agrees 98.7% of the time and
OpenCV's default INTER_LINEAR only 28.2%.

M2, M4 and M5 preprocessing is taken from the checkpoints' own metadata strings
and Tanuj's handover, and is NOT independently reproduced here. The
interpolation used for M2's aspect-preserving resize in particular is not
recorded anywhere, and the M3 result is direct evidence that guessing it wrong
is not a rounding error. Treat their masks as unvalidated until each has its
own verify script. Nothing downstream should present them otherwise.
