verifyModel3.py
===============
Prove that our M3 (optic disc / fovea localization) preprocessing reproduces
the model's own published predictions.

    python verifyModel3.py

── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
M3 is the only checkpoint that documents NOTHING about itself. It carries no
in_channels, no normalization, no preprocessing string and no channel meanings
-- confirmed by reading the file. Everything about how to feed it was
reverse-engineered, so "it looks about right" is not enough: a localization
error does not stay local. The optic-disc/fovea axis defines the quadrant
mapping, quadrant counts are what the ICDR rule engine grades on, and a rotated
axis silently changes the grade rather than failing.

So the recipe is proven the same way Branch A's was: reproduce the model's own
published outputs (models/Model3/localization_test_predictions.csv) from the
raw images. Agreement is the evidence. This project has twice been saved by
that control -- it caught MATLAB's PyTorch importer computing wrong numbers
from a structurally correct import, and it caught a CLAHE stage that training
never used.

── WHAT IT ESTABLISHED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The recipe is: plain squished resize to 512x512 with **INTER_AREA**, BGR->RGB,
ImageNet normalization, argmax per channel, ch0 = optic disc, ch1 = fovea,
coordinates in 512-space mapped back by (xW/512, xH/512).

INTERPOLATION IS NOT A DETAIL HERE, which is the point worth keeping:

    INTER_AREA      98.7% exact   (77/78)
    INTER_LINEAR    28.2% exact
    INTER_CUBIC     26.9% exact
    INTER_LANCZOS4  25.6% exact
    INTER_NEAREST   12.8% exact

INTER_LINEAR is OpenCV's default and the obvious thing to write. It agrees with
the model on barely a quarter of images. Nothing in the checkpoint says
otherwise, and a pipeline built on it would have looked entirely reasonable.

── THE IMAGE-RESOLUTION TRAP ───────────────────────────────────────────────
IDRiD's localization Training and Testing folders reuse filenames: all 103
testing filenames also exist in the training folder. Tanuj's split draws from
BOTH (63 train, 14 test here), and the CSV records only a bare `image_id`, so
the id alone does not identify an image.

Reading the wrong folder first is not a loud failure -- it silently grades a
different patient's eye. Measured, it looked like a preprocessing problem:
mean OD error 26 px and a bimodal error distribution. The same collision
already produced one wrong committed conclusion on this project.

So each id is resolved by checking WHICH folder's ground truth reproduces the
CSV's own od_true columns under the 512 mapping. That is unambiguous: it
resolved 77 of 78 rows with zero ties.
