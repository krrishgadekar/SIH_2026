% BRANCHAINFERMATLAB  Branch A inference via the imported MATLAB dlnetwork

% matching PyTorch checkpoint branchAInfer.py serves), given an

%   out = branchAInferMatlab(tensorPath, gradcamPath)
%

% docstring) so gradingOrchestrator.js's calling/parsing code does not change
% -- only which backend it shells out to (INFERENCE_BACKEND=matlab|python).
%
% ── BRANCH_A_MODEL_VERSION=branchA_v1|branchA_v2a (v2a integration, GATE 4) ─
% Env var, default branchA_v1 (see versionCfg below). Selects the .mat, the
% calibration file (NEVER calibration_v1.json for v2a -- a different
% filename, plus an explicit modelVersion-field guard), the tensor size used
% only for the initialize() fallback, and the modelVersion/imgSize/
% preprocessing fields in the returned struct. tensorPath's own tensor size
% must already match the selected version -- that is
% preprocessBranchATensor.py's job (it reads ckpt["img_size"] from whichever
% checkpoint BRANCH_A_MODEL_VERSION resolves to Python-side), not this
% function's.
%
% ── CONTRACT CHANGE (2026-09-19): NO IMAGE PREPROCESSING HAPPENS HERE ──────
% This function used to do its own preprocessing via preprocessForBranchA.m /
% preprocessModel1.m -- a hand-maintained MATLAB PORT of the Python
% ben_graham chain. That port had a real, measured residual (SSIM 0.981, not
% 1.0 -- preprocessModel1.m's own header) that was small in pixel terms but
% large enough to flip the predicted grade on 1/10 and the conformal tier on
% 2/10 real images, even though the imported network matched Python to 2e-6
% given IDENTICAL input (training/parityCheck.m). The fix is not a tighter
% port. It is not maintaining a second implementation at all:
%
%   tensorPath is a .mat written by ml-pipeline/inference/
%   preprocessBranchATensor.py, which calls branchAInfer.preprocess() --
%   the EXACT function branchAInfer.py's own Python inference path uses for
%   every image. This function's job is to load that tensor and call
%   predict(). Preprocessing exists in exactly one place in this codebase
%   now: preprocess() in branchAInfer.py.
%
% tensorPath's .mat contains:
%   x        (384,384,3,1) single, SSCB layout, ImageNet-normalized --
%            handed to dlarray(x,'SSCB') and predict() with no further
%            transformation.
%   display  (384,384,3) uint8, ben_graham-enhanced RGB, the SAME pixels x
%            was computed from one step before normalization -- Grad-CAM's
%            overlay background (must be the ENHANCED image, i.e. what the
%            network actually saw, not the plain crop -- see
%            preprocessBranchATensor.py's docstring).
%
% ── WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE branchAInfer.py, NOT INSTEAD OF IT ────────────
% branchAInfer.py's own header explains why Branch A ran in Python in the
% first place: MATLAB's DIRECT PyTorch converter (importNetworkFromPyTorch)
% imported this exact architecture wrong -- 8-11% class agreement, -0.25
% correlation against the model's own published logits, despite importing
% "structurally fine" (see testImportedNetwork.m). That failure does NOT
% apply here: this .mat came from a DIFFERENT path (torch.onnx.export ->
% importNetworkFromONNX), independently verified against the same PyTorch
% model on 10 real IDRiD images at max|diff| ~2e-6 (post-softmax) -- see
% training/parityCheck.m.
%
% ── RAW LOGITS, NOT THE NET'S OWN OUTPUT ────────────────────────────────────
% The saved `net` has a terminal softmax baked in (the handoff contract
% requires it, for classifyBranchA.m's direct callers). Temperature scaling
% needs to divide LOGITS by T before softmax, so this function reaches past
% that terminal layer with predict(net, X, 'Outputs', 'x_head_Gemm') to get
% the pre-softmax Gemm output, then applies temperature + softmax itself --
% the same two-step branchAInfer.py does. argmax is invariant to both
% monotonic transforms, so the predicted grade does not depend on this choice;
% the calibrated confidence and conformal tier do.
%
% ── ONE KNOWN, DELIBERATE FIDELITY GAP ──────────────────────────────────────
%   - uncertaintyScore (MC-Dropout, Task 6.1): NOT computed. forward() on
%     this specific imported network returns a bit-identical default output
%     across repeated calls even though the same dropout layer, requested as
%     an explicit intermediate 'Outputs' target, is independently confirmed
%     stochastic -- an unexplained MATLAB/ONNX-import interaction, not a
%     shrug. Reporting null + a reason, rather than guessing and risking the
%     exact failure mcDropout.py's own docstring is written around: zero
%     variance silently reads downstream as MAXIMUM certainty.
% This does not affect drGradeCnn, confidenceScore, referable, or
% conformalTier, which is what tiering and the DB write actually consume.
% (gradcamMap/gradcamWarning, previously also listed here as gaps, are now
% moot the same way they always were -- gradCam.m only ever returned a
% finished PNG, unrelated to this contract change.)

% ── BRANCH_A_MODEL_VERSION switch (v2a integration, GATE 4) ─────────────────
% Style matches INFERENCE_BACKEND: an env var read once per call, default
% stays the currently-deployed model. Whatever spawns this MATLAB process
% (or the shell, for a direct/manual run) sets it; nothing here needs
% gradingOrchestrator.js to name it explicitly, the same way INFERENCE_
% BACKEND already reaches this process without this file naming it either.
% DEFAULT CHANGE (v2c integration, 2026-09-21): branchA_v2c passed every
% gate (ONNX/MATLAB parity, revised cross-fit guards, calibrated end-to-end
% agreement with the Python backend) and is now the deployed default,
% replacing branchA_v1. ROLLBACK: set BRANCH_A_MODEL_VERSION=branchA_v1 in
% the environment (or spawning process) to restore the previous model with
% no code change -- every v1 code path in this file is untouched and still
% fully supported.
% TEMP REVERT (2026-09-21): back to branchA_v1 until the v2c binaries are
% distributed to the deployment targets. See docs/flip_default_v2c.patch to
% restore v2c once they are.
