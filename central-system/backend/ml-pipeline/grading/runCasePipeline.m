function out = runCasePipeline(inputPath)
%RUNCASEPIPELINE  The MATLAB half of one case's grading, as a callable function.
%
%   out = runCasePipeline(inputJsonPath)
%
% Everything gradingOrchestrator.js needs back from MATLAB for a single case:
% the camera-family cross-check (Task 6.3), neovascularization suspicion (§J),
% Branch B's rule-engine grade and branch agreement (Tasks 5.1/5.2),
% lesion-attention consistency (Task 7.1) and the evidence sentence (Task 7.3).
%
% ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
% This logic used to be a ~60-statement chain that gradingOrchestrator.js
% assembled into ONE line and handed to `matlab -batch`. That cost a fresh
% MATLAB start on every case -- about 20 s of the ~50 s a case took, paid again
% for each one. As a function it can run inside the already-warm persistent
% session (runMatlabInferenceSession.m), which pays that start once.
%
% Being a real file is worth as much as the speed. The generated one-liner
% needed a semicolon after every `if` and `end` because the whole script was
% joined onto a single line -- two comments in the generator existed only to
% explain that trap. Nothing here can be broken by string concatenation, and it
% can be read, edited and called directly from the MATLAB prompt.
%
% ── INPUT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
% A JSON file (gradingOrchestrator.js's buildCasePipelineInput) with:
%   imagePath       the fundus image; anything readFundusImage reads, DICOM too
%   caseId          for the evidence report's header
%   cameraDeviceId  what the worker said the camera was -- cross-check ONLY
%   redQ, brightQ   4 lesion counts per quadrant, or null when segmentation
%                   did not run: the rule engine then refuses to grade rather
%                   than grading an eye nothing looked at
%   vesselPath      segInfer's vessel mask, and opticDisc as [x y], both in
%   odXY            ORIGINAL image pixels (the same frame)
%   ruleOpts        venousBeadingQuadrants / irmaQuadrants / foveaUnreliable,
%                   each present ONLY when genuinely measured (§H, §I)
%   branchAGrade    the classifier's grade, or null
%   camMap          the raw Grad-CAM, and the lesion/ROI masks at Branch A's
%   lesion384Path   384 geometry. Nothing re-derives that geometry here: doing
%   roi384Path      so is how a misaligned mask scores attention against the
%                   wrong pixels and still returns a plausible number.
%
% A missing or null field always means "not available", never a default -- see
% the [] handling throughout. An absent detector signal makes the rule engine
% say the criterion was NOT assessed, which is the whole point of §H: an
% all-false mock must never be passed in to make the evidence text look
% complete.
%
% ── OUTPUT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
% One struct, encoded by the caller with jsonencodeAscii (NOT jsonencode:
% stdout on Windows is the ANSI code page, which silently drops the em dashes
% the evidence text is full of -- see ml-pipeline/inference/jsonencodeAscii.m).
% Every "did not run" value is [], which jsonencode renders as null, so it
% reaches Postgres as NULL and never as a measured 0 or false.

req = jsondecode(fileread(inputPath));

% ── Task 4.6: readFundusImage, not imread ───────────────────────────────────
% Desktop fundus cameras export the Ophthalmic Photography IOD, not JPEG; until
% this went in, such a file could not have been graded at all. Ordinary images
% take the identical imread path.
imagePath = reqStr(req, 'imagePath');
[img, imgMeta] = readFundusImage(imagePath);

% ── Task 6.3: camera family ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
% The worker-reported device is passed in for the CROSS-CHECK only, never to
% steer classification: the pixels are what the model actually sees, so image
% evidence wins and a disagreement is reported rather than resolved in favour
% of the paperwork (design doc §9.4).
%
% A DICOM file names the device that took the photograph, which is better
% evidence than the worker's dropdown -- and it is deliberately NOT substituted
% here. classifyCameraFamily matches against a table of known device keys, and
% a free-text DICOM string ("Topcon TRC-NW400") matches nothing, so
% substituting it would silently SUPPRESS this check rather than improve it.
% The device is recorded as evidence instead, in out.dicomDeviceModel.
[cameraFamily, cameraDetail] = classifyCameraFamily(img, reqStr(req, 'cameraDeviceId'));

% ── §J: neovascularization suspicion ────────────────────────────────────────
% nvScore stays [] when it could not run -- reported as NULL, never as a
% measured 0.
%
% The rule engine now gets 0 ALWAYS (nvForRule), not just when the score is
% missing: the score failed its validation and must not decide anything. See
% the note at the assignment below for the numbers and the reason.
vesselPath = reqStr(req, 'vesselPath');
odXY       = reqRow(req, 'odXY', 2);
nvScore = [];
nvForRule = 0;

    if nvDetail.valid
        nvScore = nvS;
        % nvForRule DELIBERATELY STAYS 0 -- the score is reported, never graded on.
        %
        % The score was validated against ground truth and FAILED (Tanuj, ML
        % Layer Final Report, 2026-09-21): AUC 0.286 separating PDR on IDRiD
        % test (n=103) and 0.379 on Messidor-2 (n=1,744). Both are at or below
        % chance, so the design's 0.6 threshold for asserting grade 4 has no
        % support. The cause was investigated rather than guessed: the vessel
        % model is trained on healthy CHASE_DB1 retinas and segments LESS
        % vessel signal on more diseased ones, a confound that runs opposite to
        % the NV signal the score tries to isolate.
        %
        % Feeding it in was bounded -- ruleEngineGrade caps at 3 -- but not
        % harmless: above 0.6 it changed the criterion that fired and set
        % isLowerBound, which can escalate a case's tier. A worse-than-chance
        % signal must not move a grade or a tier at all.
        %
        % The measured value still reaches the caller as out.nvSuspicionScore,
        % so the signal stays visible and auditable; it simply decides nothing.
        % TO RE-ENABLE: this needs a detector that separates PDR above chance,
        % not a threshold change -- set nvForRule = nvS then, and only then.
