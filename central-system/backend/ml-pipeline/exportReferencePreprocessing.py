exportReferencePreprocessing.py
===============================
Run the ACTUAL training preprocessing (ben_graham.py -> clahe_enhance.py) and
write the result to disk, so the MATLAB port in preprocessModel1.m can be
diffed against it rather than against another of my own implementations.

    python exportReferencePreprocessing.py <image> [<image> ...] --out <dir>

Writes, per input image:
    <out>/<stem>_reference.png    what the model was actually trained on

── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Branch A (Model1) was trained on this Python chain. The serving path is MATLAB.
preprocessModel1.m ports the recipe from the Python SOURCE, which is not the
same as matching the Python BINARY: cv2.createCLAHE and adapthisteq normalise
their clip limits differently, cv2.INTER_AREA and imresize are not identical,
and OpenCV's MORPH_ELLIPSE is not MATLAB's strel('disk').

Until the port is checked against this output, "the chains agree" is a claim
about two files I wrote, not about the model's actual input. That distinction
is the whole point — the failure being guarded against is silent, so the
verification has to be real.
