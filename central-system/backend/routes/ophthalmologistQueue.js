/**
 * routes/ophthalmologistQueue.js  (Task 3.5)
 *
 * Mounted at /api/v1/ophthalmologist.
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/ophthalmologist/queue -> 200 [ queue rows, priorityRank ascending ]
 *
 * ── The ranking rule, and why it is computed in SQL ─────────────────────────
 * api-contracts.md, checkpoint version:
 *   Tier C ranked 1-100 by uncertaintyScore DESCENDING  (most uncertain first)
 *   Tier B ranked 101-200 by confidenceScore ASCENDING  (least confident first)
 *   Tier A never appears — it auto-clears and skips this queue entirely.
 *
 * Both orderings put the case the model is least sure about at the top, which
 * is the entire point: reviewer time is the scarce resource in this system, so
 * it goes where the model is weakest, not where the disease is worst.
 *
 * ROW_NUMBER() in SQL rather than sorting in JS, because the ranks must be
 * assigned over the WHOLE queue. Ranking a page of results in JS would give the
 * first row of page 2 a priorityRank of 1.
