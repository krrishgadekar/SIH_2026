# Demo setup and verification — one laptop

Everything runs on a single machine: both backends, PostgreSQL, the five models,
MATLAB, and a browser pointed at either the Vercel frontend or a local one.

**Why one machine and not two.** The hosted frontend reaches the backend at
`http://localhost:5000`, and `localhost` always means *the machine running the
browser*. Splitting them needs a tunnel or a LAN address, and a plain-HTTP LAN
address is blocked as mixed content from an HTTPS page. A second laptop is only
worth it to demo offline sync (see the last section).

Versions below are what this system is **known to run on**, not minimums —
they are the ones the pipeline was verified against.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Component | Version verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ (tested on 24.11) | `node -v` |
| Python | **3.10.9** | must be on PATH as `python` |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | needs a database and a user |
| MATLAB | **R2026a** | licensed install; see toolboxes below |

### MATLAB toolboxes

Measured with `matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts` against the live
pipeline — these three are **required**:

- Image Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Medical Imaging Toolbox  *(DICOM reading, Task 4.6)*

Optional, only for work that is not on the demo path:

- MATLAB Compiler — rebuilding `qualityGate.exe` (Task 8.1)
- SimEvents — the district queueing model (Task 3.8)

Check what you have:

```matlab
ver
```

### Hardware

| | |
|---|---|
| RAM | **8 GB minimum, 16 GB comfortable** |
| Peak inference | ~2.0 GB (segmentation 1.6 GB + Branch A 0.4 GB, run concurrently) |
| Disk | 1.1 GB models + datasets + ~1 GB node_modules |
| Per case | **~12.5 s** end to end |

No GPU needed. The verified install is **CPU-only PyTorch**.

## 2. Model weights — get these first

The five `.pt` checkpoints are **not in git** (55–280 MB each, two over GitHub's
100 MB file limit). Copy them into `central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/models/`.

The **folder names do not matter**. `modelPaths.py` resolves checkpoints by
filename anywhere under `models/`, so any layout works — but two copies of the
same filename is a hard error rather than a guess.

Required filenames:

```
branchA_v1.pt              # classifier      (Branch A)
vessel_unet_v1.pt          # vessels         (M2)
localization_v1.pt         # disc / fovea    (M3)
bright_lesion_unet_v1.pt   # exudates        (M4)
red_lesion_unet_v1.pt      # MA + HE         (M5)
```

Verify all five resolve:

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/inference
python modelPaths.py
```

Expect five absolute paths and `all five checkpoints resolved`. Exit code 1 and
a `MISSING:` line means a file is absent or ambiguous.

---

## 3. Python dependencies

Only five packages are needed to **run** the pipeline:

```bash
python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
python -m pip install timm segmentation-models-pytorch opencv-python numpy
```

> `ml-pipeline/requirements.txt` asks for CUDA 12.1 wheels plus pandas, scipy,
> scikit-learn, matplotlib and albumentations. Those are for **training and the
> offline experiments**, not for grading a case. The verified working install is
> the CPU build above. Install the full file only if you intend to re-run the
> Phase 9 experiments.

Verify:

```bash
python -c "import torch,timm,cv2,numpy,segmentation_models_pytorch as smp; print('torch',torch.__version__,'timm',timm.__version__,'cv2',cv2.__version__,'smp',smp.__version__)"
```

Known-good: `torch 2.14.0+cpu · timm 1.0.29 · cv2 5.0.0 · smp 0.5.0`.

---

## 4. Node dependencies

Four separate packages, each needs its own install:

```bash
cd central-system/backend  && npm install
cd ../frontend             && npm install
cd ../../phc-local-app/backend  && npm install
cd ../frontend                  && npm install
```

`phc-local-app/backend` uses **better-sqlite3**, which compiles a native
addon. On Windows that needs build tools; if `npm install` fails there, install
the VS Build Tools (C++ workload) and retry.

---

## 5. Configuration

One `.env` at the **repository root** — both backends load it.

```ini
# --- required ---
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/dr_screening_central
MATLAB_EXECUTABLE=matlab
MATLAB_TIMEOUT_MS=120000

# --- optional, sensible defaults exist ---
# PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python
# PORT=5000
# CENTRAL_URL=http://localhost:5000
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
# SMS_DRY_RUN=1
```

**CORS defaults already cover the demo.** With `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` unset, the
allow-list is the usual dev ports plus `https://*.vercel.app` — Vercel mints a
new subdomain per deployment, so a pinned URL would break on the next push. Set
the variable only to narrow it.

`SMS_DRY_RUN=1` keeps Twilio from sending real messages. Leave it on unless you
have credentials and intend to demo live SMS.

---

## 6. Database

```bash
createdb dr_screening_central          # or create it in pgAdmin
cd central-system/backend && npm run setup-db
cd ../../phc-local-app/backend && npm run setup-db   # creates the local SQLite file
```

Verify the schema:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "\dt"
```

Expect 12 tables: `cases`, `corrections`, `explainability_outputs`,
`grading_results`, `model_versions`, `notifications`,
`ophthalmologist_reviews`, `patients`, `phc_sites`, `referrals`,
`segmentation_outputs`, `users`.

---

## 7. Start it

Three terminals:

```bash
# 1 — central backend  (grading, ophthalmologist queue, admin)
cd central-system/backend && npm start        # → :5000

# 2 — PHC local backend (capture, quality gate, sync)
cd phc-local-app/backend && npm start         # → :4000

# 3 — frontend, ONLY if not using the Vercel one
cd central-system/frontend && npm run dev     # → :5173
```

On boot the central backend prints how many stranded cases it recovered — that
is normal and means the queue is doing its job.

---

## 8. Verification ladder

Run these in order. Each one isolates a different layer, so the first failure
tells you which layer is broken.

### 8.1 Models load and run — no server, no database

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/inference
python modelPaths.py
python branchAInfer.py ../../../../datasets/2.jpg
python segInfer.py ../../../../datasets/2.jpg
```

Branch A prints one line of JSON with `drGradeCnn`, `confidenceScore`,
`conformalTier`, `uncertaintyScore`. On `datasets/2.jpg` expect **grade 3,
confidence ≈ 0.8173, tier B**.

segInfer prints `opticDisc`, `fovea`, `redPerQuadrant`, `brightPerQuadrant` and
a `verified` block.

### 8.2 The recipes still reproduce the models' own published output

This is the check that catches a broken preprocessing chain — the failure mode
that produces plausible, wrong numbers rather than an error.

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/inference
python verifyModel3.py        # expect 77/78 exact  -> "recipe REPRODUCES the model"
python verifySegModels.py     # expect M2 100.000% exact, M5 max diff < 0.001
```

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/experiments
python verifyRuleEngineCounts.py   # expect 14/14 sum(red), 14/14 rule grade
```

### 8.3 MATLAB works and the rule engine is sane

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/grading
matlab -batch "testBranchB"                    # expect 54/54 passed
```

```bash
cd central-system/backend/ml-pipeline/explainability
matlab -batch "testPhase7Explainability"       # expect 58 checks, 0 failed
```

```bash
cd phc-local-app/backend/quality-gate-matlab
matlab -batch "testQualityGateDeploy"          # expect 22 checks, 0 failed
```

### 8.4 CORS — the hosted frontend can actually reach the backend

```bash
cd central-system/backend && node middleware/testCors.js   # expect 26 checks pass
```

With the central backend running, confirm a real preflight:

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ophthalmologist/queue -H "Origin: https://demo.vercel.app" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
```

Expect `204` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://demo.vercel.app`.
A lookalike origin must get **no** such header:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ophthalmologist/queue -H "Origin: https://evil-vercel.app"
```

### 8.5 End to end — the one that matters

```bash
node verify_task33.js      # POST a case, poll, assert every field
node verify_task34.js      # PHC capture -> sync -> central -> graded
```

Expect `Task 3.3 DoD met` and `Task 3.4 DoD met`.

> These two scripts are **not tracked in git** (they were removed from the repo
> deliberately). They exist on this laptop. If they are ever lost, section 8.6
> is the fallback that needs no test harness.

### 8.6 One-command health check (no test scripts needed)

With the central backend running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

Then confirm the full pipeline has actually written everything:

```bash
cd central-system/backend && node -e "const p=require('./db/pgClient');(async()=>{const r=await p.query(\`SELECT g.dr_grade_cnn cnn,g.dr_grade_rule_engine rule,g.branch_agreement agree,g.conformal_tier tier,g.uncertainty_score unc,e.lesion_attention_consistency_score lac,e.gradcam_path IS NOT NULL gradcam,s.lesion_counts->>'redTotal' red FROM grading_results g LEFT JOIN explainability_outputs e USING(case_id) LEFT JOIN segmentation_outputs s USING(case_id) ORDER BY g.graded_at DESC LIMIT 1\`);console.table(r.rows);process.exit(0)})()"
```

**A usable system shows all of these non-null:** `cnn`, `tier`, `unc`, `lac`,
`gradcam`, `red`. `agree` may legitimately be `null` — that means the rule
engine returned its ceiling grade of 3, which is a lower bound ("≥3") and
neither confirms nor contradicts Branch A.

Check nothing is wedged:

```bash
cd central-system/backend && node -e "const p=require('./db/pgClient');(async()=>{const r=await p.query(\"SELECT status,count(*) FROM cases GROUP BY status\");console.table(r.rows);process.exit(0)})()"
```

Cases sitting on `processing` for more than a minute or two mean grading is
stuck — restart the central backend and stranded-case recovery will re-queue
them.

## 9. Known failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint '<name>.pt' not found` | weights not copied in | section 2 |
| `checkpoint is AMBIGUOUS — 2 copies` | duplicate file under `models/` | delete the stale one |
| `Failed to spawn MATLAB` | not on PATH | set `MATLAB_EXECUTABLE` to the full `matlab.exe` path |
| Case stuck on `processing` | queue died mid-flight | restart central backend; recovery re-queues |
| Case goes straight to `error` in ~7 s | MATLAB or Python missing — classified permanent, not retried | check `MATLAB_EXECUTABLE` / `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` |
| Browser: CORS / network error, server log silent | request blocked before reaching Express | section 8.4 |
| Frontend shows data with backends stopped | `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` | frontend-side change, not backend |
| Grading takes ~12 s | expected — 5 models + MATLAB | not a fault |

---

## 10. What is not wired, so nobody hunts for it

Stated so these read as decisions rather than bugs on demo day:

- **`nvSuspicionScore` is always NULL.** No neovascularization detector runs;
  `neovascularizationSuspicion.m` exists but nothing calls it. Branch B
  therefore cannot reach grade 4 at all, by design — a CNN grade 4 is escalated
  to Tier C instead, because no second opinion is possible.
- **Camera calibration is detected, not applied.** The family is classified and
  a reported-vs-detected mismatch is logged, but no per-family pixel correction
  reaches the model. Applying one would feed the network an input distribution
  it was never trained on.
- **The PHC quality gate cannot read DICOM.** It still uses `imread`, so a
  `.dcm` cannot complete capture → sync end to end. The central pipeline reads
  DICOM fine.
- **`USE_MOCK_DATA = true`** in both frontends. Until that flips, the UI shows
  fabricated data and never calls these backends.
- **`ML_API_ENDPOINT`** in the PHC frontend points at a separate ngrok FastAPI
  service, not this pipeline. If that is what demos, none of Branch B, the
  conformal tiering, the evidence report or Grad-CAM appears on screen.

---

## 11. If you do use a second laptop

Only worth it to show offline-first sync, which is a genuine differentiator.

Laptop 2 runs the PHC backend with `CENTRAL_URL=http://<laptop-1-ip>:5000`.
Disconnect the network, capture cases, reconnect, watch them sync.

**The catch:** laptop 2 needs MATLAB for the quality gate, or `qualityGate.exe`
plus the free MATLAB Runtime R2026a — and **that Runtime path has never been
tested on a machine without MATLAB**. Try it well before the day, not on it.

The same story can be told from one laptop by pointing at `capturedAt` being
earlier than `receivedAt` on a synced case, which is the actual evidence that
the case was taken offline and uploaded later.
