/**
 * exportTrainingSet.js — build a retraining corpus out of what doctors decided.
 *
 *   node scripts/exportTrainingSet.js --list
 *   node scripts/exportTrainingSet.js --out <dir> [--copy-images] [--all]
 *                                     [--include-unconsented] [--dry-run]
 *
 * Reads `dataset_labels` (written by services/datasetCollector.js as each
 * review is submitted) and writes a manifest, a dataset card, and optionally
 * the images themselves. Exported rows are stamped with the batch id so a
 * training run can be reproduced, and so the next export can pick up only
 * what is new (the default; `--all` re-exports everything).
 *
 * ── THE RULES THIS ENFORCES, AND WHY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. CONSENT IS REQUIRED. A row whose patient had not consented at labelling
 *    time is excluded, and the count of exclusions is printed and written into
 *    the dataset card rather than quietly dropped. `--include-unconsented`
 *    exists for a research dataset where consent is handled out of band; it
 *    prints a warning and stamps the card, because a corpus that cannot say
 *    whether it may be used is a corpus nobody can safely use.
 *
 * 2. ONE LABEL PER CASE — the newest. A case reviewed twice has two rows on
 *    purpose (the audit trail), but two contradictory training examples of one
 *    image is label noise, and the later review is the reviewer's settled view.
 *
 * 3. ONE EXAMPLE PER IMAGE. Deduped by sha256, so the same eye submitted twice
 *    under different case ids does not get double weight. A duplicate whose
 *    two labels DISAGREE is reported, not silently resolved: two doctors
 *    grading the same bytes differently is a finding about the corpus.
 *
 * 4. NO PATIENT IDENTIFIERS LEAVE. The manifest carries case_id, the label and
 *    the image — never name, contact number or patient_id. Exported filenames
 *    are the sha256, not anything traceable to a person by inspection.
 *
 * 5. AN IMAGE WHOSE BYTES CHANGED IS DROPPED. The hash is re-checked at export;
 *    a mismatch means the file is not the one that was graded, and labelling
 *    the wrong photograph is worse than a smaller dataset.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS CORPUS IS NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not a random sample of screening. Tier A cases are auto-cleared and
 * never reach a reviewer, so only Tier B/C — the cases the model was least
 * sure about — are here. Training on it as if it were representative shifts
 * the model toward the hard tail and away from the ordinary negatives that
 * dominate real screening. The dataset card says so, in the corpus itself,
 * because that warning has to travel with the data rather than live in a chat
 * message someone half-remembers.

## Read this before training on it

**This is not a random sample of screening.** Tier A cases are auto-cleared and
never reach a reviewer, so every example here is a case the system was unsure
about (Tier B or C) or one flagged for another reason. The ordinary negatives
that dominate real screening are under-represented by construction. Fine-tuning
on this corpus alone will shift a model toward the hard tail; mix it with the
original training distribution rather than replacing it.

**A confirm is a weaker label than an override.** It means the reviewer did not
disagree with the grade they were shown, having seen that grade first. Anchoring
is real: that is not the same as an independent reading. \`label_source\` is in
the manifest so the two can be weighted differently.

**Grade 4 is rare here** for the same reason it is rare everywhere in this
project, and a handful of examples cannot fix a recall problem on that class.

## Provenance and safeguards

- Consent: ${includeUnconsented
    ? '**INCLUDED WITHOUT CONSENT** (`--include-unconsented`). Rows whose patient had not consented at labelling time are present. Do not distribute this corpus.'
    : 'every example had patient consent recorded at labelling time.'}
- Excluded: ${skipped.unconsented} without consent, ${skipped.missingFile} image file missing, ${skipped.hashMismatch} image bytes changed since labelling, ${skipped.noHash} unverifiable, ${skipped.alreadyExported} exported in an earlier batch.
- Deduplicated by SHA-256. ${disagreements.length} identical image(s) carried conflicting labels; the newest review was kept and the conflict is listed in the export log.
- No patient identifiers: the manifest carries case ids and labels only${copyImages ? ', and image files are named by content hash' : ''}.
- Labels are one row per review in \`dataset_labels\`; this export took the newest per case.

Generated ${new Date().toISOString()}.
