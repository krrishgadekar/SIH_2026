# Datasets

**None of these are in git, and none are currently downloaded.** `datasets/`
holds five loose sample fundus images used for smoke-testing and nothing else.
Everything below has to be fetched by hand before the tasks that need it can run.

This file is the blocker for Phase 4. Tasks 4.1–4.3 train U-Nets and cannot
start without DRIVE and IDRiD.

## What each dataset unblocks

| Dataset | Size | Labels | Needed by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DRIVE** | 40 images | pixel-level vessel masks | Task 4.1 vessel U-Net | ⬜ not downloaded |
| **IDRiD — segmentation** | 81 images | pixel-level lesion masks (MA, HE, EX, SE) | Tasks 4.2, 4.3 | ⬜ not downloaded |
| **IDRiD — grading** | 516 images | DR + DME grade 0–4 | Tasks 2.2/2.3 | ⬜ not downloaded |
| **IDRiD — localization** | 516 images | optic disc + fovea coordinates | Task 4.5 refinement, and its DoD | ⬜ not downloaded |
| **APTOS 2019** | 3,662 images | DR severity 0–4 (image-level) | Tasks 2.2/2.3 | ⬜ not downloaded |
| **Messidor-2** | ~1,748 images | adjudicated DR grading | Task 9.3 external validation | ⬜ not downloaded |

Task 4.5 (optic disc / fovea) and Task 4.4 (NV suspicion) are built and testable
**without** any of these — they are classical CV. Only the U-Nets and the
metric-reporting tasks are blocked.

## Where to get them

| Dataset | Source |
|---|---|
| DRIVE | <https://drive.grand-challenge.org/> — registration required |
| IDRiD | <https://idrid.grand-challenge.org/> — registration required; also mirrored on IEEE DataPort |
| APTOS 2019 | <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data> — Kaggle account + competition rules acceptance |
| Messidor-2 | <https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor2/> — request form |

All four are free for research use but **all four require you to accept licence
terms**. Read them: some prohibit redistribution, which is a second reason (on
top of size) that none of this belongs in git.

## Expected layout

The code resolves these paths literally. Unzip to match exactly, or the
datastore builders in `training/` will silently find zero images and report a
successful run on an empty set.

## Two warnings worth reading before training

**A near-empty datastore does not error.** `imageDatastore` over a folder that
does not match returns zero files, and training on it reports a clean run with
meaningless metrics. Always check the file count first.

**These are real patient images.** They are de-identified and licensed for
research, but they are still fundus photographs of real people. Do not commit
them, do not put them in a shared drive that is public, and do not paste them
into third-party services. `.gitignore` covers the folders listed above; if you
unzip somewhere else, add that path too.
